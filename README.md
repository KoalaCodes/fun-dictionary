## In this Project I set out to use the jQuery library and AJAX method to work with a dictionary
## api. 

	In this project I demonstrate profiency not only with jQuery but with css as well.
this project depended on css styling.

	the first steps were to establish structure in html. once that was set up you can develop the constants in jQuery.

	then develop the the functionality.

 below is the wireframe I drew.
I strayed from the wire frame but happy with how it ended up.

biggest challenges were to select an api and work with it.

goals accomplished: highly stylized webpage. minimal look. api data retrieval. functional apps.


Future Goals: to personalize the website a bit further. adding memory storage maybe even a game
where people who learn words. rankings.profiles.
